-An if statement can be used to conditionally execute code, depending on whether or not the if statement's condition is True or False\
-An elif( that is,'else if') statement can follow an if statement. Its block executes if its conditon is True and all of the previous conditons have been false. \
An else statement comes at the end. It is block is executed if all of the previous conditons have been false.\
The value 0,0.0, and empty strings are condiered to be falsey values. When used in a conditon they are consider false. You can always see for yourself which values are Truthy or falsey by passing them to the bool() function \

\
\
-When the execution reaches the end of a while statement's block, it jumps back to the start to recheck the conditon. \
-Presss Ctrl + c to interrupt an infite loop \ 
-A break statement causes the execution to immediately leave the loop, without re-checking the conditon. \
-A continue statement causes the execution to immediate;y jump back to the start of the loop and re-check the conditon \
